Me? No, I rather not. 

I've probably checked a million times, but sometimes, it just, works.

To give a quick overview, this is a **dump**, and I say that with assurance that you will most likely find the most random stuff in my repositories. Not quite of an organized or productive person in that fact, but instead loves to never delete their unused repos.

As of last that this document is edited, I'm learning matrices, integration, and graphing, which, yes, I do have plans to integrate into Python as a programming language by itself. 

I'm supposing the vast (check it out, repo in pinned (not a pun, the actual meaning (no, really.))) majority of the people reading this are from Discord, meaning, 1, hi! And 2, dm me for Python help if you need it (please don't come asking about 3rd party libraries, I'm not PyPi, I don't know what they all do).
